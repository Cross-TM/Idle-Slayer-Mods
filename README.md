# Idle Slayer Mods

Repository for mods that I have created for the game Idle Slayer. 

## Installation & Usage

In order to mod Idle Slayer on steam you need to do the following:

- Find the Idle Slayer game folder.
  - You can usually do this by right-clicking Idle Slayer in your steam library, then click on Manage, and then Browse local files.
- Download [BepInEx](https://www.nexusmods.com/idleslayer/mods/1?tab=files) and open up the file
- Drag all contents from the window that just opened into the Idle Slayer game folder.
- You should now have a BepInEx folder inside the Idle Slayer game folder
- Inside this BepInEx folder you should have a plugins folder - this is where you want to drag any downloaded mods in

Once you have downloaded a mod, the steps are similar to the above, you would simply open up the downloaded mod file, and drag all contents (usually just a folder in there) into the plugins folder mentioned in the steps above.
